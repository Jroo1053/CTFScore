# CTFScore Apache Demo

This is an example of a minimal deployment of this CTFScore intended to demonstrate the containerised deployment pattern on a single host. This is not a full CTF as the only target is a apache server with no **intended** vulnerabilities. This deployment also only features a NIDS (Suricata) which, reduces the attack-tracking ability of the system significantly.
