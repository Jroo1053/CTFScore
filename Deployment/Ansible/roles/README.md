# CTFScore - Ansible Deployment Playbook

This playbook can be used to deploy the [demo ctf](tryhackme.com/jr/idsevasion) locally. This playbook can also be used as a base for building new CTFs. Note that, for convenience's sake this playbook uses preset keys. These keys should be changed before the system is deployed publically otherwise, users will be able to influence the validity of the scoring system. This playbook also assumes that you have root SSH access to a Ubuntu 20.04.3 instance.
